## attempt 1

Brute force solution copied from Bryan Hunter's solution. One prisoner is the leader; each non-leader prisoner turns the light on once in their lifetime. If the light is already on, they leave it on and wait until the light is off to do their light switching.

#### 1a

####

The leader is randomly chosen independently of the first person to visit the room.
